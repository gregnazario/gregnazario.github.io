## Seattle Life and Tech Blog
My blog about the outdoors, and pacific northwest lifestyle.  Information around my love of the outdoors and fitness associated with running, skiing, hiking, cycling, rock climbing and others.  In addition, I'll post some of my personal opinions about tech, and how for software engineers to become better engineers and better communicators.

### About Me
I'm a software engineer from Pennsylvania, who upon moving to Seattle decided to take upon the challenge of being a more outdoorsy, more active life and it stuck.  More information about me can be found at my main website [gnazar.io](https://gnazar.io)
