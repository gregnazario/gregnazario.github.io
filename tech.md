## Learning how to communicate

When interviewing candidates for a job, the number one skill that you can't read on a resume is their communication skills.  Communication skills can make or break a team, and if it's bad enough, it can cause people to be miserable.  Communication isn't a skill well taught in college from coding classes, but it can be learned by all of us through practice.

How many of you have heard about [Toastmasters](https://toastmasters.org)?  Toastmasters is a club that helps all people work on their communication and leadership skills.  I helped start the [Amazon Blackfoot Toastmasters club](https://www.toastmasters.org/Find-a-Club/06732807-amazon-blackfoot) while working at Amazon, and it gave great insights into public speaking and communication skills in general.

I'll start today with presentations and provide other insights in the future.

### Prepared presentations

In our professional careers, at some point we'll need to stand up and give a talk, a brownbag, or some prepared presentation to others.  It's a great stepping stone for leadership, showing initiative, and learning how to disseminate information in a formal way.  However, I've watched many fumbled presentations where the person speaking clearly hasn't prepared and loses the interest of the people listening.  This discourages people from speaking up in the future, and I want to give some basic insights into presentations.

#### Know your audience

If your audience are people on your direct team, maybe you can use specific abbreviations and jargon.  However, if you are giving a presentation to a different teams or people who may not know the specifics you're talking about, keep it high level.  When in doubt, it's better to be at a high level, and explain abbreviations or concepts some attendees may not understand.

#### Keep your presentations simple

Have you watched a powerpoint presentation where there's a giant wall of text?  Ask yourself these questions.

* *Am I reading things directly off the slide?* - If so attendees don't need to listen to me, and I could have just handed them a document instead.
* *Can attendees glance at it quickly and understand?* - Providing useful numbers to show impact can be helpful.  Graphics can be much more powerful.
* *Does it distract from what I'm saying?* - You're talking in front of a room.  You want them to look at you as you speak, and ensure they're actively listening.
* *How do these slides add value?* - Sometimes it's helpful to have a slideshow where the slides provide a natural flow and splitting of sections of your talk.  

Keeping these questions in mind, I abide by the rule less is more. A few bullet points and an image, or just an image can be powerful and conveying an idea, while still keeping the focus on you as the main medium for information.

#### Memorize ideas and points not words

Depending on the audience, requires different levels of preparation.  If you're a CEO or a president giving a speech to a large group of people, where the way you say something matters, then every word should be planned.  However, in most smaller venues, it's better to keep a flow of what are the **ideas** you want to convey, and **how** you structure your speech to convey it.

Generally, when I give a speech, I will memorize transitions between topics and sections, as well as metrics and quotes I want to give.  By keeping the speech around **ideas** rather than words, it allows the speech to be flexible, when there is an interruption.  Maybe an attendee wants to ask a question, or you sneeze and you lose what was the last word you said.  With memorizing what *ideas* you want to convey, it brings you into the realm of unprepared informal speeches.  These unprepared speeches will make you loosen up and it will be more akin to having a conversation with your audience.  This will change the conversation from talking **at** them, and more about talking **with** them, keeping your audience engaged.
