## Training for a Half Marathon

In 2014, I did the Seattle half with a blazing for me 1:45:37 time.  The last half I ran I ended up injuring my knee pretty badly with chronic problems.  I'm looking forward to running another half marathon in 2020 and training has become an issue again.  I highly don't suggest anyone else trains for only 2 months prior to a half like I did, but I did have the following insights.

1. **Build up the miles week over week** - I ran on the treadmill inside away from the Seattle rain usually 4 days a week, which let me build up from 5 miles a week to, 20 miles on the treadmill a week.  This helped build a regular pace and the stamina for running.
2. **Spend one day a week on distance** - By building up the total miles week over week, the total stamina is built up, but you still need to actually get to race distance.  I spent this time running around my local lake (Seattle's lake union), which helped build up my distance until I was ready for the race.
3. **Rest days are important** - Starting from nothing and running up to 5 days in a row really took a toll on my legs.  Especially when starting training, taking a day off between runs or between having multiple run days in a row lets you recover, and spend some time doing something else than running.
