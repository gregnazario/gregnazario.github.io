# Why make a separate repo just for my blog?

Well, the short answer was, building a blog by hand was a lot of work, and github pages is automatic and easy.
Simple to write in Markdown, and put parts in.  I'm planning on some point using a different framework for my
blog in the future that might be a little less simple.
